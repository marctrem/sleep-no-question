#SleepNoQuestion

This project is simple enough. It only turns off the phone. It can do it because it's signed with the platform certificate.

This repo is meant to be cloned in the AOSP project in ./packages/apps/ . It's target name is SleepNoQuestion.

You can see a demo of it [here](http://marctrem.com/sleep-no-question.ogv)
